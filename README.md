# Weather-Analysis-Animation

The purpose of this small program is to create an analysis of weather patterns over the past couple decades between a few US cities. While many cities data could be added to this and further updates could include an API and selecting cities interactively, here only csv files for Duluth, Minneapolis and Milwaukee have been included.

The data is read in, cleaned and then outputted in an animation format so that over the past 20 years, the temperature for each month can be reviewed as a whole for each city comparatively.
